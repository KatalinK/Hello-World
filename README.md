# Hello-World
Katalin's baby steps
I have worked with large, unruly datasets for many years. I was once responsible for traceability for a project where the number of possible combinations ran into the billions and I needed to make sense of it all as well as convincing my line-managers why it is a bad idea to have such level of complexity.
Cold rainy winter Sunday afternoon in Melbourne,Australia. Wondering about how a friend is settling in literally across the world.
